# Progress Component

This is a simple progress component built with [Lit](https://lit.dev/). It will show a progress indicator that shows the progress of a task, from 0 to 1, as a percentage. It also displays a message that describes the task.

In addition, it stores that last 25 messages that were displayed, and allows the user to view them by clicking on the message to expland the message history.

## Documentation on the build process
